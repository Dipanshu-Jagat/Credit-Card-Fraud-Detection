A credit card fraud detection project involves the development of a system or application that identifies and prevents fraudulent transactions on credit and debit cards. This is a critical application in the financial industry, as it helps protect both cardholders and financial institutions from unauthorized and potentially damaging transactions. Below is a detailed project description for a credit card fraud detection system:

## Summary 
* All Fraud Transactions occur for an amount below 2500. Thus, the bank can infer clearly that the fraud committers try to commit frauds of smaller amounts to avoid suspicion.
* The fraud transactions are equitable distributed throughout time and there is no clear relationship of time with commiting of fraud.
* The number of fraud transactions are very few comparted to legitimate transactions and it has to be balanced in order for a fair comparison to prevent the model from overfitting.
